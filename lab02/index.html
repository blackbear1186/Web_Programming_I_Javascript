            <h2>The Top 10 Dishes of Japan</h2>
            <p>This website is for people who visit Japan or foreigners who live in Japan
                and want to know what is good to eat and drink. I have personally tried all of the dishes on this list.
            Foreigners who live or have visited Japan may not beware that some of the
            dishes exist. Therefore, I wanted to present this list of the best foods so
            that foreigners can try these delicious dishes. I have also included links to
            other websites that shows highly recommended drinks, snacks, as well as food.
                I included snacks and food from Hokkaido on the list because Hokkaido has
                the best snacks in Japan and some of the best tasting dishes.
            If you plan on visiting Japan, I highly recommend you try the food on this list.
            I can almost guarantee that you will not be disappointed.</p>

            site contains information about what to eat while visiting or living in Japan. These are the dishes
                that I can eat everyday, eventhough, I am American and love American food.
