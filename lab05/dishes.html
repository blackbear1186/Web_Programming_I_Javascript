                <h2>The Top 5 Dishes of Japan</h2>

                <p>These are the top 5 most popular dishes in Japan:</p>
                <ul id="top_dishes">
                    <li>Ramen</li>
                    <li>Tempura</li>
                    <li>Butadon</li>
                    <li>Shabu Shabu</li>
                    <li>Soup Curry</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Ramen</h3>

                <figure id="fig_img">
                    <img src="images/ramen.jpg" id="ramen" class="rame" alt="Ramen">
                    <figcaption id="figcap_dish">Shoyu Ramen with pork</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Ramen is well known around the world. In America, we eat cup of noodles or ramen in a package. In Japan,
                    restaurants prepare ramen in delicious soup full of vegetables and some meat. Ramen is great for fall and winter
                    time when it gets cold. My favorite ramen is made with tonkatsu inside, which is found in a small mom and pop shop.
                </p>


                <h3>Tempura</h3>

                <figure id="fig_img">
                    <img src="images/tempura.jpg" id="temp" alt="Tempura">
                    <figcaption id="figcap_dish">Miso Soup and Crispy Tempura</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Tempura can be served with rice, soba or udon. Tempura is normally made with seafood and vegetables. The best tempura
                    is found in Izu on the main Island of Japan. Some places that make tempura put some special sauce on them that takes
                    the flavor to another level. My favorite are shrimp, squid, oyster, pumpkin, and okra tempura. Tempura is definitely
                a favorite of mine.</p>

                <h3>Butadon</h3>
                <figure id="fig_img">
                    <img src="images/butadon.jpeg" id="buta" alt="Butadon">
                    <figcaption id="figcap_dish">Deliciously Flavor sauteed pork</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This dish is one that many foreigners have no idea exist when they travel to Japan. Thinly sliced pork with sauteed
                   in a special sauce that taste heavenly. Something is strange about eating Butadon because you can eat more than you normally
                can eat. If you don't like rice, there is no problem because they meat flavor is so good, eating rice is easy. This
                is probably my favorite way to eat pork.</p>

                <h3>Shabu Shabu</h3>

                <figure id="fig_img">
                    <img src="images/shabu.jpg" id="shabu" alt="Shabu Shabu">
                    <figcaption id="figcap_dish">Dip Your Meat In The Soup</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>My first experience with eating Shabu Shabu was at home with my wife. She has made Shabu Shabu for the family many times and it is
                absolutely delicious. I have gone a restaurant to eat it once which was great too. It is a Japanese soup filled with vegetables and mushrooms.
                And you take thin pork and dip it in the soup while it is cooking and wait a few minutes, then take it out and eat. I highly recommend every one
                try Shabu Shabu.</p>

                <h3>Soup Curry</h3>
                <figure id="fig_img">
                    <img src="images/soup_curry.jpg" id="curry" alt="Soup Curry ">
                    <figcaption id="figcap_dish">Mouth burning Soup Curry</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This probably my favorite Japan food to eat. Soup curry taste so good and you can't find it any where else on earth. Everything is big. The potatoes
                are big. The carrots are big....all the vegetables are big. The soup is probably the best part of the dish. The soup taste so good that you take a
                scoop of rice and dip it in the soup and eat it. This is the number one Japanese dish I would encourage foreigner in Japan to eat.</p>
