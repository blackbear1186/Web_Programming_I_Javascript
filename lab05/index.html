                <h2 id="first_h2" class="first">The Best Dishes of Japan</h2>


                <p>This website is for people who visit Japan or foreigners who live in Japan
                    and want to know what is good to eat and drink. I have personally tried all of the dishes on this list.
                Foreigners who live or have visited Japan may not beware that some of the
                dishes exist. Therefore, I wanted to present this list of the best foods so
                that foreigners can try these delicious dishes. I have also included links to
                other websites that shows highly recommended drinks, snacks, as well as food.
                    I included snacks and food from Hokkaido on the list because Hokkaido has
                    the best snacks in Japan and some of the best tasting dishes.
                If you plan on visiting Japan, I highly recommend you try the food on this list.
                I can almost guarantee that you will not be disappointed.</p>



            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

                <p>Although, my wife is Japanese and cooks food from all over the world. This
                site contains information about what to eat while visiting or living in Japan. These are the dishes
                    that I can eat everyday, eventhough, I am American and love American food.
                Japan has some the best food you can eat anywhere in the <strong>World.</strong></p>
